                I’m <strong>Valessa Lopes</strong>, a Full Stack Developer in
                training, passionate about technology and creating digital
                solutions that generate real impact. My journey in programming
                began with curiosity about how things work, and today I continue
                to grow through continuous learning, hands-on projects, and
                ongoing study.
              </p>

              <p>
                I focus on developing modern applications using
                <strong> React, Next.js, and TypeScript</strong>, while also
                building complete solutions that involve front-end development,
                back-end with
                <strong> Node.js</strong>, <strong>API</strong> integration, and
                <strong> database</strong> management. I always strive to
                combine clean code practices, organization, and a great user
                experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                I am constantly evolving, exploring new technologies, improving
                my skills, and applying everything I learn through personal and
                professional projects, with the goal of growing as a developer
                and delivering efficient, well-structured solutions.
